      # `npm i -g corepack@latest;` and  `corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate;` are necessary to get the latest
      # version of corepack, which has a fix for https://github.com/nodejs/corepack/issues/612
      # (related https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/9029), so it can install pnpm.
      # Those two can probably go away once the devcontainer is using a version of Node which includes a version corepack
      # with the fix.
