# Arbitrary Variants Extractor

A more complex extractor to support arbitrary variants for utilities.

```html
<div class="[&>*]:m-1 [&[open]]:p-2"></div>
```

Will be captured with `[&>*]:m-1` and `[&[open]]:p-2` as variants.

This extractor is included in [`@unocss/preset-mini`](/presets/mini) as the default extractor. Normally you don't need to install this package manually.
